# gdReshade : Reshade extension for Godot

this [extension](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) compiles and exposes [Reshade](https://github.com/crosire/reshade) shaders natively within the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)

It makes it easier to experiment with postprocessing (Reshade has a very healthy community developping for it) or simply as an example when starting on your own extension (the SConstruct file in particular is made for being repurposed).

There's a demo project that shows how to use the extension.
