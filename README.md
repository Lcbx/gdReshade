# gdReshade : Reshade extension for Godot

this [extension](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp)'s mission is to import [Reshade](https://github.com/crosire/reshade) shaders natively within the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
It's an experiment with both postprocessing and writing an extension.

Biggest TODO: write a custom ```reshadefx::codegen``` class to generate gdshader code instead of glsl (right now you have to do the [conversion to gdshader](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/converting_glsl_to_godot_shaders.html) by hand).

There's a demo project that shows how to use the extension.
Please take a look at the [GDextension issue tracker](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel/issues/442) before reporting an issue.
